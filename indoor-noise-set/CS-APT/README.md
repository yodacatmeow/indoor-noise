# CS-APT

**(Coming Soon!)**

CS-APT** is an inter-floor noise dataset collected in CHULSAN-JOOGONG APT. A single microphone in a smartphone (Samgsung Galaxy S6) was used as a receiver to record inter-floor noises. Inter-floor noises were sampled at 44,100 Hz for ~5 s.

**CS-APT** includes 4 different inter-floor noise types. They are: an machine learning method was evaluated on this dataset: medicine ball falling on the floor from a height of 1.2 m (**MB**), a hammer dropped from 1.2 m above the floor (**HD**), hammering (**HH**), and dragging a chair (**CD**).

Inter-floor noises were generated on the upper floor, lower floor, and above two floors based on the position of the receiver.

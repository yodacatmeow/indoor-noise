# SNU-B36-50E

**SNU-B36-50E** is an inter-floor noise dataset collected in building 36 at Seoul National University. **SNU-B36-50** (*older version with smaller number of audio clips*) is rearranged into here. A single microphone in a smartphone (Samgsung Galaxy S6) was used as a receiver to record inter-floor noises. Inter-floor noises were sampled at 44,100 Hz for ~5 s.

The inter-floor noises included in this dataset can be classified into 5 types or 19 positions. The inter-floor noise types are a medicine ball falling to the floor from a height of 1.2 m (**MB**), a hammer falling from 1.2 m above the floor (**HD**),  hammering (**HH**), dragging a chair (**CD**), and a running vacuum cleaner (**VC**).

*(ToDo: img_19 positions)*

Each audio clip can be labeled as a noise type and a position.

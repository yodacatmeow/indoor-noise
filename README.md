# Indoor-noise

In residential buildings, noise generated by residents or home appliances propagates through building structure and annoys residents on other floors. It is difficult for human to precisely identify the type/position of inter-floor noise, and some conflicts between residents have originated from this incorrect estimation of type/position. Correctly **identifying the noise type and position** is considered to be the first step in solving noise problem.

We built [three different datasets](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set) to study this problem.

### Single acoustical sensor

A noise signal over a single microphone with a sufficient time duration might contain the dispersive nature of the plate wave or unidentified features. We used data-driven approach to catch these features and identify the noise signal. 



### Study

- [IWAENC 2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8521392) ([repo.](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/VGG16-SNU-B36-50))
  - In this work, an method for inter-floor noise type/position classification was proposed and validated against an inter-floor noise dataset.
  - We built an inter-floor noise dataset [SNU-B36-50](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/SNU-B36-50) in an office building.

- [Appl. Sci.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/18/3735) ([repo.](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/inter-floor-noise-classification/appl-sci))
  - This paper is expanded version of IWAENC 2018.
  - Type/position classification of noise at unlearned positions was shown.
  - We collected [inter-floor noise](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set/SNU-B36-50E) at new positions around the noise source positions in [SNU-B36-50](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/SNU-B36-50)  and the new data was not used in learning.

- ICASSP 2020 (*submitted*, [repo.](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/inter-floor-noise-classification/icassp))
  - In this paper, the generalizability of the proposed method in [Appl. Sci.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/18/3735) was addressed against inter-floor noise in residential buildings.
  - We collected inter-floor noise in two apartment buildings.

- Mobile phone application (repo.)
  - The single acoustical sensor approach can be implemented on a smartphone device.
  - Our inter-floor noise identification method was implemented into a smartphone application (*iOS*).

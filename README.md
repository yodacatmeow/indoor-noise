# Indoor-noise

In residential buildings, noise generated by residents or home appliances propagates through building structure and annoys residents on other floors. Correctly **identifying the noise type and position** is considered to be the first step in solving noise problem.

To study this problem, we built [three different datasets](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set).

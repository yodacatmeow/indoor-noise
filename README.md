# Indoor-noise

In residential buildings, noise generated by residents or home appliances propagates through building structure and annoys residents on other floors. It is difficult for human to precisely identify the type/position of inter-floor noise, and some conflicts between residents have originated from this incorrect estimation of type/position. Correctly **identifying the noise type and position** is considered to be the first step in solving noise problem ... (H. Choi *et al*, 2019).

To study this problem, we built [three different datasets](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set).

| Name                                                         | Building type      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| [SNU-B36-50E](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set/SNU-B36-50E) | Office building    |
| [CS-APT](https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set/CS-APT) | Apartment building |
| [BDML-APT]( https://github.com/yodacatmeow/indoor-noise/tree/master/indoor-noise-set/BDML-APT) | Apartment building |
